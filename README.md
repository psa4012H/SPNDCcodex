Topic:-🩸 Blood Donor-Patient Connector

A web application that connects blood donors with patients in need within the same geographical area. Donors can register via a form, and patients can search for available donors nearby based on blood type and location.

🧠 Inspiration

During emergencies, finding a blood donor on time can be life-saving. Our goal is to streamline the process of connecting willing donors with patients in real time especially within local areas — through a simple, user-friendly platform.

🔍 Features

- 📝 Donor Registration Form
- 📍 Geographical Matching (local area-based search)
- 🔎 Search by Blood Type and Location
- 📲 Contact Option for Patients to Reach Donors
- 💡 Simple and Responsive UI

🛠 Tech Stack

- Frontend: HTML, CSS 
- Backend: Node.js, Javascript, React

📦 Folder Structure

🧗 Challenges We Faced

- Setting up real-time location-based search
- Ensuring smooth integration between frontend and backend
- Designing a minimal but effective user interface under time constraints

💡 Future Improvements

- SMS/Email alerts for patients and donors
- Deployment to a cloud platform (e.g., Render, Vercel, or Heroku)
